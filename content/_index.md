title: Welcome to my garden
---
Here, you’ll find reflections around my main interests: data, critical thinking, personal finance, software, cognitivism, and mathematics.

I primarily write for myself: improving your writing [helps](https://paulgraham.com/writes.html)improve your thinking. However, I’ll be glad if some of my content proves useful to you as well.    

The folder structure is heavily inspired by [JZhao](https://jzhao.xyz/) website:
- In [Essays](/essays/) you will find my most curated posts.
- [Thoughts](/thoughts) contains reflections about topics which were resonating sound during the writing period. They are dirtier than the Eassy and I expect to update them over the time.
- [Notes](/notes/) contains small pieces of information on a specific subject, and can be used as appendix to the essay and thoughts.

You may be interested on some specific topics; the [Tags](/tags) page will group the essay and thoughts by tags.
